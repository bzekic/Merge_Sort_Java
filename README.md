**Read Me for Merge Sorter**

This Merge Sorter was created that will take an unsorted array and sort using the divide and conquer algorithm.

A Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by recursively splitting a list of numbers in half, until the list can no longer be divided. Then the numbers can be solved directly by merging the smaller lists into a new list thatâ€™s placed in a sorted order.
